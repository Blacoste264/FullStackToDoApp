VSTDA Full Stack

For this project I have created a "Very Simple Todo App" to store Todo items in a SQL database via a RESTful Web Service.

First time incorperating an SQL Server along with Visual Studio/C#. Challenge was to build a REST Api from scratch, become familiar with Entity Framework, and successfully link front-end via AngularJS and JavaScript.

Gained sufficient knowledge of the CRUD cycle, & how to ensure any Angular promises fulfilled as efficiently as possible.
